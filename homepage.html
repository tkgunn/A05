        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an 
			all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and 
			internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, 
			and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:</p>
            <blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
                I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Season Package: $95</li>
            <li>Patron Package: $200</li>
